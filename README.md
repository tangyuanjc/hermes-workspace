## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-line install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs `hermes-agent` from PyPI, clones this repo, sets up `.env`, and installs deps. Then:

```bash
hermes gateway run                  # terminal 1
cd ~/hermes-workspace && pnpm dev   # terminal 2
```

Open http://localhost:3000. That's it.

---

### Manual install

Hermes Workspace works with any OpenAI-compatible backend. If your backend also exposes Hermes gateway APIs, enhanced features like sessions, memory, skills, and jobs unlock automatically.

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **An OpenAI-compatible backend** — local, self-hosted, or remote
- **Optional:** Python 3.11+ if you want to run a Hermes gateway locally

#### Step 1: Start your backend

Point Hermes Workspace at any backend that supports:

- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `GET /v1/models` recommended

Example Hermes gateway setup:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install hermes-agent
hermes setup
hermes gateway run
```

If you're using another OpenAI-compatible server, just note its base URL.

### Step 2: Install & Run Hermes Workspace

```bash
# In a new terminal
git clone https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace.git
cd hermes-workspace
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
printf '\nHERMES_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8642\n' >> .env
pnpm dev                   # Starts on http://localhost:3000
```

> **Verify:** Open `http://localhost:3000` and complete the onboarding flow. First connect the backend, then verify chat works. If your gateway exposes Hermes APIs, advanced features appear automatically.

#### Environment Variables

```env
# OpenAI-compatible backend URL
HERMES_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8642

# Optional provider keys for Hermes gateway-managed config
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Optional: password-protect the web UI
# HERMES_PASSWORD=your_password
```

---

## 🧠 Local Models (Ollama, Atomic Chat, LM Studio, vLLM)

Hermes Workspace supports two modes with local models:

### Portable Mode (Easiest)

Point the workspace directly at your local server — no Hermes gateway needed.

### Atomic Chat

```bash
# Start workspace pointed at Atomic Chat
HERMES_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1 pnpm dev
```

Download [Atomic Chat](https://atomic.chat/), launch the desktop app, and make sure a model is loaded before starting Hermes Workspace.

### Ollama

```bash
# Start Ollama
OLLAMA_ORIGINS=* ollama serve

# Start workspace pointed at Ollama
HERMES_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 pnpm dev
```

Chat works immediately. Sessions, memory, and skills show "Not Available" — that's expected in portable mode.

### Enhanced Mode (Full Features)

Route through the Hermes gateway for sessions, memory, skills, jobs, and tools.

Here are two explicit `~/.hermes/config.yaml` examples for the local providers we support directly in the workspace:

**Atomic Chat**

```yaml
provider: atomic-chat
model: your-model-name
custom_providers:
  - name: atomic-chat
    base_url: http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1
    api_key: atomic-chat
    api_mode: chat_completions
```

**Ollama**

```yaml
provider: ollama
model: qwen3:32b
custom_providers:
  - name: ollama
    base_url: http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
    api_key: ollama
    api_mode: chat_completions
```

You can adapt the same shape for other OpenAI-compatible local runners, but `Atomic Chat` and `Ollama` are the two built-in local paths documented in the workspace UI.

**2. Enable the API server in `~/.hermes/.env`:**

```env
API_SERVER_ENABLED=true
```

**3. Start the gateway and workspace:**

```bash
hermes gateway run          # Starts on :8642
HERMES_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8642 pnpm dev
```

All workspace features unlock automatically — sessions persist, memory saves across chats, skills are available, and the dashboard shows real usage data.

> **Works with any OpenAI-compatible server** — Atomic Chat, Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp, LocalAI, etc. Just change the `base_url` and `model` in the config above.

## 🐳 Docker Quickstart

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Codespaces-Open-181717?logo=github)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=outsourc-e/hermes-workspace)

The Docker setup runs both the **Hermes Agent gateway** and **Hermes Workspace** together.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**
- **Anthropic API Key** — [Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) (required for the agent gateway)

### Step 1: Configure Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace.git
cd hermes-workspace
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API key:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

> **Important:** The `hermes-agent` container requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to function. Without it, the gateway will fail to authenticate.

### Step 2: Start the Services

```bash
docker compose up
```

This starts two services:

- **hermes-agent** — The AI agent gateway (port 8642)
- **hermes-workspace** — The web UI (port 3000)

### Step 3: Access the Workspace

Open `http://localhost:3000` and complete the onboarding.

> **Verify:** Check the Docker logs for `[gateway] Connected to Hermes` — this confirms the workspace successfully connected to the agent.

---

## VPS Production Deployment

The ai-hotboard VPS uses Nginx in front of the Node production server. Deploy
the Nginx site template from `launchd/nginx-ai-hotboard.conf` to the VPS path:

```bash
sudo cp launchd/nginx-ai-hotboard.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/ai-hotboard
sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/ai-hotboard /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ai-hotboard
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

The `/assets/` location is intentionally separate from app routes so hashed Vite
assets can use `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Workspace loads but chat doesn't work"

The workspace auto-detects your gateway's capabilities on startup. Check your terminal for a line like:

```
[gateway] http://127.0.0.1:8642 available: health, models; missing: sessions, skills, memory, config, jobs
[gateway] Missing Hermes APIs detected. Update Hermes: pip install -U hermes-agent && hermes gateway run
```

**Fix:** Upgrade to the latest stock `hermes-agent`, which now ships the extended endpoints:

```bash
pip install -U hermes-agent
hermes gateway run
```

If you were on the old `outsourc-e/hermes-agent` fork, it's no longer needed as of v2 — uninstall it and install upstream instead.

### "Connection refused" or workspace hangs on load

Your Hermes gateway isn't running. Start it:

```bash
cd hermes-agent
source .venv/bin/activate
hermes gateway run
```

### Ollama: chat returns empty or model shows "Offline"

Make sure your `~/.hermes/config.yaml` has the `custom_providers` section and `API_SERVER_ENABLED=true` in `~/.hermes/.env`. See [Local Models](#-local-models-ollama-lm-studio-vllm) above.

Also ensure Ollama is running with CORS enabled:

```bash
OLLAMA_ORIGINS=* ollama serve
```

Use `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` (not `localhost`) as the base URL.

Verify: `curl http://localhost:8642/health` should return `{"status": "ok"}`.

### "Using upstream NousResearch/hermes-agent"

v2+ runs on vanilla `hermes-agent` with full feature parity. `pip install -U hermes-agent` gets you the extended endpoints (sessions, memory, skills, config). **No fork required, ever.**

If you're pinned to an older `hermes-agent` version and missing endpoints, the workspace will degrade gracefully to **portable mode** with basic chat — upgrade upstream to restore full features.

### Docker: "Unauthorized" or "Connection refused" to hermes-agent

If using Docker Compose and getting auth errors:

1. **Check your API key is set:**

   ```bash
   cat .env | grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   # Should show: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   ```

2. **View the agent container logs:**

   ```bash
   docker compose logs hermes-agent
   ```

   Look for startup errors or missing API key warnings.

3. **Verify the agent health endpoint:**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8642/health
   # Should return: {"status": "ok"}
   ```

4. **Restart with fresh containers:**

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up --build
   ```

5. **Check workspace logs for gateway status:**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs hermes-workspace
   ```
   Look for: `[gateway] http://hermes-agent:8642 mode=...` — if it shows `mode=disconnected`, the agent isn't running correctly.

### Docker: "hermes webapi command not found"

The `hermes webapi` command referenced in older docs doesn't exist. The correct command is:

```bash
hermes --gateway   # Starts the FastAPI gateway server
```

The Docker setup uses `hermes --gateway` automatically — no action needed if using `docker compose up`.
